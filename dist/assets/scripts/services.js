I've never been much for blogging (I'm usually satisfied with 140 characters of shouting into the abyss) but given this new direction my life has taken I feel it only right to start sharing it with you (everyone) Having left dreary Lonodn and my stalling career in sales I went back to my first love - technology. 8 weeks of intensive practical learning (mmm, my favourite kind) I had a foothold in the world of programming. From this foothold I could see the vastness of what I didnt know. So followed months of practice and experimention, trying different styles, frameworks and learning new ones. I have learnt a lot, about myself and the languages I write in and now begin my new life freelancing in Barcelona.  I hope we get to work together some day! :)",
